# DataStructures_With_Python

***Problem1:***
For our first problem, the goal will be to design a data structure known as a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. 
An LRU cache is a type of cache in which we remove the least recently used entry when the cache memory reaches its limit. 
For the current problem, consider both get and set operations as an use operation.

***Problem2:***
Finding Files
For this problem, the goal is to write code for finding all files under a directory (and all directories beneath it) that end with ".c"

***Problem3:***
Huffman coding
Assume that we have a string message AAAAAAABBBCCCCCCCDDEEEEEE comprising of 25 characters to be encoded. 
The string message can be an unsorted one as well. 
We will have two phases in encoding - building the Huffman tree (a binary tree), and generating the encoded data. 
Based on the Huffman tree, generate unique binary code for each character of our string message. 
For this purpose, you'd have to traverse the path from root to the leaf node.

***Problem4:***
Active Directory
In Windows Active Directory, a group can consist of user(s) and group(s) themselves. 
We can construct this hierarchy as such. Where User is represented by str representing their ids.
Write a function that provides an efficient look up of whether the user is in a group.

***Problem5:***
Blockchain
A Blockchain is a sequential chain of records, similar to a linked list. 
Each block contains some information and how it is connected related to the other blocks in the chain. 
Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. 
For our blockchain we will be using a SHA-256 hash, the Greenwich Mean Time when the block was created, and text strings as the data.
Use your knowledge of linked lists and hashing to create a blockchain implementation.

***Problem6:***
Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists
Your task for this problem is to fill out the union and intersection functions. 
The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B.
The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A âˆ© B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B.
You will take in two linked lists and return a linked list that is composed of either the union or intersection, respectively. 
Once you have completed the problem you will create your own test cases and perform your own run time analysis on the code.
